# Censorship Case: Habr vs. Aeterna Libertas

## Evidence Documentation

### 1. Moderation Timeline Violation
- **Claimed standard**: 24-hour moderation
- **Actual wait**: 99+ hours (4.14x longer)
- **Queue mathematics**: 400+ articles should have been processed during this period

### 2. Support Response Evidence
- "Moderation terms are not regulated"
- "Moderator is guided by sense of beauty" 
- "Ask UFO, we don't comment on moderation decisions"
- "Text resembles a shopping list"

### 3. False AI-Generation Claims
- Telegram bot (@layer_ai_detector_bot) used as "expert tool"
- Git history and authorship proofs ignored
- Selective formatting criticism while similar structured articles are approved

### 4. Technical Censorship Patterns
- 403 errors when accessing sandbox
- 404 "page expired" after rejection
- "Something went wrong" errors when attempting to publish critique

### 5. Institutional Double Standards
- "We are a closed community" admission
- Different rules for established vs new users
- Subjective "interestingness" overrides formal compliance

## Analysis

### Systemic Failures Identified
1. **Arbitrary timeline enforcement** - Rules for users but not platform
2. **Subjective content evaluation** - "Sense of beauty" over published guidelines  
3. **Pseudoscientific verification** - Telegram bot as "expert tool"
4. **Technical censorship mechanisms** - 403/404 errors as suppression tools
5. **Institutional dishonesty** - "Closed community" revealed only after pressure

### Impact Assessment
- Platform demonstrated inability to handle advanced technical content
- Moderation system operates on subjective preference rather than rules
- Creates chilling effect for complex or novel research topics

## Conclusion

Habr has demonstrated systematic failure in:
- Transparent moderation processes
- Objective content evaluation  
- Technical competence in handling complex topics
- Institutional honesty about platform governance

This case serves as documentation of platform decay when closed systems prioritize community control over knowledge dissemination.
