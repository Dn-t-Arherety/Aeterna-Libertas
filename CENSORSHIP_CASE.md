HABR CENSORSHIP CASE - AETERNA LIBERTAS

Project: Aeterna Libertas — architecture for interstellar consciousness transfer
Moderation Delay: 99+ hours (standard: 24 hours)
Status: Systematic censorship confirmed

Key Evidence of Platform Failure:

1. 99+ Hours Delay
   · 4x longer than standard moderation period
   · Mathematical proof: 400+ articles should have been processed
2. Support Statements Proving Censorship
   · "Moderator guided by sense of beauty" (replacement of rules with subjectivity)
   · "We can remove post from moderation" (censorship as solution)
   · "Your speculations and free interpretations" (dismissal of logical arguments)
3. Systemic Contradiction
   · Habr enforces 24-hour rules for users
   · Habr ignores same standard for own moderation
   · Proof of double standards

Complete Conversation Timeline:

```
NOV 15, 10:40 - Post submitted: "Aeterna Libertas: distributed consciousness architecture"
NOV 18, 15:30 - 77+ hours: First formal request for decision
HABR RESPONSE: "Please provide link to Regulation you are referring to"
NOV 18, 16:21 - My response: Reference to 24-hour user publication rules
HABR RESPONSE: "This rule doesn't apply to moderation. Timelines aren't regulated"
NOV 19 - 99+ hours:
HABR: "Moderator guided by sense of beauty"
HABR: "We can remove post from moderation" 
HABR: "Your speculations and free interpretations of rules"
MY FINAL: Documented as evidence of platform failure
```

Technical Context:

· Post contains pure technical architecture (Neuro-Core, .mind format, galactic protocols)
· No rules violations detected
· Project represents engineering approach to consciousness preservation

Conclusion:
Habr demonstrated inability to handle content beyond basic web development topics. Case serves as perfect example of platform censorship mechanisms against innovative research.
